# 📚 Tutorial Hub – Weekly Web Development Tasks

Welcome to the **Tutorial Hub Repository**!

## 📅 Week 1 – Build a Mini Web Page

For Week 1, the challenge was to create a simple HTML page titled **"My Favorite Animal"**. This task was designed to reinforce basic HTML structure, tags, and semantic markup.

* An **image** of the chosen animal, sourced from a free and publicly accessible image URL.
* A **paragraph** (`<p>`) explaining *why* this animal is the favorite.
* An **unordered list** (`<ul>`) of **3 cool facts** about the animal.
* A **hyperlink** (`<a>`) to the animal’s **Wikipedia page**, set to open in a new browser tab.

### 🧠 Key Requirements Met:

* ✅ Used **at least 5 different HTML tags** (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<img>`, `<a>`)
* ✅ Included **alternative text** for the image for accessibility
* ✅ Incorporated both a **heading tag** and a **paragraph tag**
